# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for its
public API surface (the HTTP API + the `hkgov-py` client).

## [Unreleased] — Dataset coverage expansion

> Exhaustive coverage of the HKSAR Gov open-data APIs. The HKMA connector now
> serves the entire public catalog; the data.gov.hk connector now serves every
> resource the v2 filter API actually accepts. All endpoints probe-verified
> live (HTTP 200 + `header.success`) during this work.

### Added
- **Related market players (`GET /v1/market-players`).** A curated directory of
  the named private-sector operators in each license-issuing department's stream
  (HKMA → HSBC/BOCHK/…; IA → AIA/Prudential/…; OFCA → PCCW/SmarTone/…; plus
  SFC, TD, TIA, FEHD). Surfaced as a per-department "Related market players"
  panel on the Licences page so users browsing a department's licences also see
  who holds them. Served from a new read-only endpoint, filterable by
  `?dept=` and `?category=`; shipped defaults (7 departments × 10 players, from
  2024–25 public sources) are overridable via `[[reference.market_player]]` in
  `config.toml` — the same empty-means-defaults contract as `agent.scan`.
  (`crates/common/src/config.rs`, `crates/api/src/routes.rs`, `dashboard/index.html`)
- **HKMA connector: full catalog (151 datasets).** Replaced the 2-dataset
  hand-written mapping with a data-driven `DATASETS` table holding every
  dataset listed under `apidocs.hkma.gov.hk/documentation`, across all 14
  sections (Monthly Statistical Bulletin ×9, Daily Monetary Statistics, Other,
  Bank & SVF Info, Debt Securities Settlement System, Trade Repository).
  Per-row `segment` / `lang` param flags are honored at fetch time — 13
  datasets need a `segment` (tender tenors, bond pricings, SVF licensees, HKTR
  disclosures) and 14 (the bank-svf-info family) need `lang=en`.
  (`crates/connectors/src/hkma.rs`)
- **data.gov.hk connector: 33 verified resources.** Extended the resources
  table from 1 to 33, covering Companies Registry (11), Correctional Services
  (6), Dept. of Health/CHP (5), OFCA (4), Education Bureau (3), Tramways (2),
  Water Supplies (1), and Centaline property (1). Each `resource_url` was
  probe-verified against `api.data.gov.hk/v2/filter` — the historical archive
  lists 376 datasets but the filter API only accepts a registered PSI subset.
  (`crates/connectors/src/datagovhk.rs`)

### Changed
- HKMA/DataGovHk `datasets()` now derive `DatasetSpec`s lazily from the table
  via a `OnceLock` projection (the table is the single source of truth).
- `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md` rewritten with the verified endpoint table, the
  segment/lang param matrix, and the registered-subset note for data.gov.hk.
- `README.md` dataset counts updated (151 HKMA / 33 data.gov.hk).

### Fixed
- DSSI path correction — the Debt Securities Settlement System datasets live at
  `/public/debt-securities-settlement-system/...`, not under
  `financial-market-infra/` (the docs URL differs from the API path; verified
  live).

## [v8] — 2026-06-22 — Product layer: Lifeline + Signals + Investigations + Bilingual + Identity

> Completes the PM strategy feature set (P-100..P-108). All 8 planned features
> are now implemented; the remaining gaps from the strategy tracker are
> dashboard UI work (which composes against these APIs) + the Postgres
> persistence tier (roadmap).

### Added
- **P-104 Insight Lifeline** — evolution-aware `InsightStore::upsert`. The store
  now detects content changes on re-fire: a changed severity/title/summary/
  confidence/producer produces an `EvolutionDiff`, bumps the version, and
  archives the prior version to a history store. Content-stable re-fires are
  now no-ops (fixes a prior bug where every pass churned `generated_at`). New
  `first_seen`, `version`, `evolution` fields on `Insight` (all `serde-default`).
  `GET /v1/insights?since=` (the "what's new since you left" filter) +
  `GET /v1/insights/{id}/history`. (`crates/agent/src/insight.rs`)
- **P-102 Signal Subscriptions** — a `Signal` is a user-owned `ScanTarget` plus
  channel routing. v1 ships authoring + preview (stateless). `preview_signal`
  runs the real detector against the last 90 days so "preview IS what will
  fire" — the determinism guarantee holds. Routes: `POST /signals`,
  `POST /signals/preview`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /signals/{id}`.
  (`crates/agent/src/signal.rs`)
- **P-105 Drill-In Investigation** — saved, resumable, shareable case files.
  From any insight, a user launches a multi-step investigation; each step
  (chip/qa/finding_promotion) is persisted. Routes: `POST /investigations`,
  `GET/DELETE /investigations/{id}`, `POST /investigations/{id}/steps`,
  `POST /investigations/{id}/notes`. (`crates/agent/src/investigation.rs`)
- **P-106 Bilingual Surface** — zh-HK insight summaries via a deterministic
  re-framer (`frame_zh_hk`) keyed by detector kind. No LLM, no scheduler change.
  `?lang=zh-HK` on `GET /v1/insights` selects the localized summary.
  (`crates/agent/src/bilingual.rs`)
- **P-108 Identity Tier** — email + magic-link identity. `POST /auth/request-
  token` issues a one-time token (provisioning the `User` idempotently);
  `POST /auth/redeem` exchanges it for a session; `GET /auth/me` resolves
  `Authorization: Bearer`. The `User.id` is the principal the per-user features
  key on as `owner`. (`crates/agent/src/identity.rs`)

### Fixed (critical)
- **`detect_threshold_crossing` was unreachable from the scheduler.** It existed
  and was tested but had no match arm in `run_one_target` — hard-blocked the
  flagship P-102 use case ("tell me when HIBOR breaks 2.5%"). Now wired, with a
  new `direction` field on `ScanTarget` (above/below, defaults above).

### Tests
- +42 tests since v7 (8 lifeline + 6 signal + 7 investigation + 9 bilingual +
  8 identity + 4 threshold-crossing). Workspace total 136 → **178**, all
  passing. clippy + fmt clean.

## [v7] — 2026-06-22 — Product layer: Silence Index + Unprecedentedness + Cite-It

> First features shipped from the PM/UX strategy
> (`docs/PM_STRATEGY/`): the highest-RICE, fully self-contained features
> that compose from existing deterministic detectors and need no
> identity/persistence infrastructure.

### Added
- **Silence Index (P-100, RICE 12,000)** — the flagship. A versioned, HKMA-scoped
  `0–100` opacity score ("how much did HKGOV not explain this period") built as a
  pure-Rust rollup of `cross_source_gap` + unattributed `series_jump` +
  missing-data days. Methodology v1.0; weights + the half-saturation squash
  constant are centralized so a methodology bump is a one-line change. New
  endpoint `GET /v1/silence-index?period=2026-Q2`. The determinism guarantee is
  the defense against "your opacity score is biased": critics reproduce it from
  the evidence. (`crates/agent/src/silence.rs`)
- **Unprecedentedness Score (P-103, RICE 10,667)** — the historical-rarity layer.
  Scores a numeric value against its own stored history: percentile rank, a
  `median ± k·MAD` "normal range" band, a 1-in-N return period, and the most
  recent prior exceedance ("last time this happened was ___"). New endpoint
  `GET /v1/unprecedentedness?source=hkma&dataset=…&field=…&value=…`. Composes
  from the same MAD math the `outlier` detector uses. (`crates/agent/src/unprecedentedness.rs`)
- **Cite-It (P-101, RICE 4,000)** — the citation/reproducibility moat. From any
  insight → a stable permalink + citation strings (BibTeX/RIS/APA/Chicago/Markdown)
  + a `ReproducibilityManifest` whose SHA-256 content hash detects upstream data
  drift (so a citation never false-claims reproducibility). New endpoint
  `GET /v1/insights/{id}/cite[?format=…&base_url=…]`. Experimental findings carry
  an honesty marker in every rendered string. (`crates/agent/src/cite.rs`)

### Added (infrastructure)
- `InsightStore::get(id)` — by-id insight lookup (powers `/cite`; P-104 will
  reuse it for the permalink landing + evolution tracking).
- `Error::NotFound` (404) + `Error::BadRequest` (400) — two common error variants
  with status-code + `kind_for` mappings.

### Tests
- +46 tests since v6 (31 for P-100/P-103 + 15 for P-101). Workspace total
  90 → **136**, all passing. clippy + fmt clean across all feature combinations.

### Documentation
- New `FEATURES_TRACKER.md` section J (F-089 → F-107) covers all three features
  with expected-behaviour specs and the unit/route tests backing each.
- PM strategy docs (`docs/PM_STRATEGY/`) are the design rationale; this entry is
  the shipped implementation of its R1.3 (P-103), R2.3 (P-101) and R2.4 (P-100)
  rows.

## [v6] — 2026-06-21 — Intelligence & agentic analysis layer

### Added
- **Richer detectors:** `outlier` (MAD robust z-score), `seasonality`
  (autocorrelation at monthly/quarterly lags), `correlation` (Pearson r flagging
  decoupling). `cross_source_gap` generalized to take `(source, dataset)`.
- **Config-driven scan:** `[[agent.scan]]` controls which detectors run on which
  datasets; empty list falls back to the v3 defaults.
- **Agent tool belt:** `list_datasets` / `query_dataset` / `run_detector` behind
  a uniform `Tool` trait with OpenAI-compatible schemas (`crates/agent/src/tools.rs`).
- **Agentic loop:** `LlmClient::step` drives multi-step reasoning, bounded by
  `max_steps`; heuristic client opts out via default impl (`loop_mod.rs`).
- **NL Q&A:** `POST /v1/ask` with heuristic keyword fallback (`qa.rs`).
- **Proactive alerting:** `AlertDispatcher` pushes severity-filtered, deduped
  insights to webhook sinks; `GET /v1/alerts`; `WebhookSink` behind the new
  `alerts` feature.
- `Error::Agent` variant; `InsightSeverity` implements `Display`.

### Fixed
- `Finding::into_insight` id now includes `dataset` (was `{kind}:{source}:{hash}`,
  which would collide as coverage widened).

### Tests
- 54 across default features; 55 with `--all-features`. Clippy + fmt clean across
  all feature combinations.

## [v5] — Public surface
